# Ping

Ping is a useful network utility for testing the reachability of a host or node in the network. It estimates round-
trip time (RTT) by calculating the duration it takes for a packet to traverse from a source to a destination and
back through the Internet. The process involves sending echo requests to destination node using Internet Control
Message Protocol (ICMP). Upon receiving an echo request message, the destination host sends an echo reply to the
source.

# Exercise
In this exercise, I will send 10 echo requests using the ping command to the following hosts. I will:
1. report the minimum, average, and maximum round-trip times (RTT) observed in ”ping-yourid.txt” file,
and

2. explain the differences observed in the minimum round-trip time to each of these hosts in ”ping-yourid.txt”
file (max 150 words).

And,

2. ox.ac.uk
3. gaia.cs.umass.edu
4. sydney.edu.au
