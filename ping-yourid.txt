# Explanation
The minimum RTT represents the shortest time it took for a packet to travel to the destination and back.
Differences in minimum RTT could be due to various factors such as geographical distance, network infrastructure, routing paths, and network congestion.
In this case:
For www.oslomet.no and ox.ac.uk, the minimum RTT is relatively low, indicating a potentially close physical distance or efficient network infrastructure.
However, for gaia.cs.umass.edu and sydney.edu.au, the minimum RTT is significantly higher, suggesting longer distances or less efficient network paths.
